# prediction_of_brain_stroke
This project focuses on developing a three predictive model that can accurately identify individuals who are at high risk of experiencing a stroke and comparing the performance of each of the models to determine the best predictive model for the given dataset. 
This will be done by analyzing a range of factors including medical history, lifestyle habits, and diagnostic tests. The aim of this project is to determine the best model for the prediction of brain stroke for the dataset given, to enable early intervention and preventive measures to reduce the incidence and impact of strokes, improving patient outcomes and overall healthcare.
